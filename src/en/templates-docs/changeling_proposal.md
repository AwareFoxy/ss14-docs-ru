## Overview

A small concept of the Changeling antagonist that takes cues from The Thing and mechanics as seen in Space Station 13. This proposal seeks to help update and expand upon the role and (hopefully) take advantage of the capabilities of the new engine.

## At A Glance

A Changeling is a hostile and hive-minded creature of unknown origin that has the ability to assimilate and shapeshift into living organisms. The Changeling takes inspiration from a creature called The Thing from a 1982 horror film of the same name directed by John Carpenter. The Changeling role was introduced in Space Station 13 with abilities similar to its inspiration and expanded upon across many servers. The addition of the Changeling role would provide variety of the rounds and a new antagonist role.

**Quick Bullet Points:**
* Changeling role is a **major team antagonist** that is assigned at round start or at late join at low player counts. There may be multiple per round but will not be assigned at round start if the round contains a conflicting antagonist role.
* Changeling abilities cost a currency called DNA Points. DNA Points are accumulated by absorbing other humanoid organisms and spent by using abilities.
* Goal of the Changeling is to absorb/assimilate enough humanoid organisms to reach the required number of DNA Points, kill any named target(s), and make it to Central Command alive and uncuffed via the escape shuttle.
* Changeling has the ability to:
  * Assimilate other organisms, copying every detail of their victim at that time
  * Shapeshift into an assimilated organism, changing their appearance and name
  * Shapeshift into a grotesque 'horror form'
  * Shapeshift arms into a tentacle or scythe for attacking
  * 'Sting' another organism to inject them with either a strong neurotoxin or hallucinogen.
  * Spit acid across a short range
* The ultimate weakness of a Changeling is fire, but they can be very momentarily incapacitated or electrocuted to gain the upper hand.
* A Changeling can be killed by completely burning or gibbing the body via machine.
* Upon reaching a high threshold for brute damage, the Changeling falls to the ground and splits into pieces like a member of the Diona species.
* A Changeling may recover from any non-lethal damage very slowly by sleeping for a long period of time.

## A Closer Look

###  Abilities
  As briefly mentioned above, the Changeling has quite the array of abilities to accomplish its goal(s). They are described more in depth in the table below. DNA Point costs range from free, minimal, small, medium, and large with large being the most expensive. All abilities have a cooldown unless stated otherwise.
  | Ability | DNA Points Cost | Description |
  |---|---|---|
  | Assimilate | Free | Begins the long assimilation process of a compatible organism that is currently grabbed or underneath the Changeling. After a certain amount of time, the victim will not be able to move, as they have been wrapped in the Changeling's tentacles. The process will be interrupted if the Changeling is stunned or moves too far away from the victim. Upon a successful assimilation, all that is left of a humanoid victim is a pool of blood and a husk that can be recycled for less biomass. Compatible organisms for assimilation include only monkeys and all humanoid races.|
  | Shapeshift | Small | The Changeling begins to contort its skin and body structure to take the form of another being. The Changeling changes its physical appearance and voice to match that of the selected form. Upon activation, a popup detailed in the Shapeshifting subsection is shown to decide what form to change into.|
  | Horror Form | Large | A toggleable ability that causes the Changeling to transform into a grotesque and unrecognizable form. In this form, the Changeling loses its abilities to sting, but gains damage reduction to all forms of damage except fire damage, increased damage dealt from abilities, and the ability to let out a ear-piercing Horrific Shriek. The Changeling may not return back to normal form for a while after transforming.|
  | Horrific Shriek | Small | Only available in Horror Form, the Changeling lets out a ear-piercing shriek that temporarily stuns all within a range without earmuffs or the Deaf trait. Those stunned will drop whatever they are holding in their hand and fall to the ground. Headsets worn by them will lose capability for the duration of the howl. May be usable again if the Changeling has enough points and the cooldown is over.|
  | Appendage Shapeshift | Medium | The Changeling transform its the arm of its active hand into a whip-like tentacle or a scythe. The tentacle can attack others from a distance for brute damage. The scythe can slash at those who are close to cause bleeding. Items held in the transformed hand are dropped. Both hands can be transformed at the same time, but must be activated one at a time.|
  | Neurotoxin Sting | Minimal | The Changeling subtlety stabs a nearby organism within whisper range with neurotoxin. The victim falls to the ground, cannot move, can only whisper until they fall into a sleep. Upon sting, they take a small amount of toxin damage.|
  | Hallucinogenic Sting | Minimal | The Changeling subtlety stabs a nearby organism within whisper range with a hallucinogen. The victim begins hallucinating and seeing things that are not really there. Upon sting, they take a small amount of toxin damage.|  
  | Spit Acid | Small |  The Changeling spits acid at a target within a close range for toxin damage. Headgear worn by the victim is rendered unusable and those without protective headgear receive burn damage to the face area. Those within sight of the Changeling are told the individual spat acid.|

### Finding A Changeling/Breadcrumbs
  * The existence of a Changeling can be confirmed by:
    * Random pools of blood in suspicious places
    * The existence of husks (the leftover bodies of assimilated victims)
    * Applying heat to drawn blood in Medical and seeing the flavor text along the lines of "the blood is running away from the heat source"
    * Combining blood from two different sources in one container in Medical and seeing the flavor text along the lines of "one of the blood samples is attacking the other"
    * Announcement from Central Command mentioning more crew members working than accounted for and missing persons reports
    * Eye witnesses accounts of attacks
