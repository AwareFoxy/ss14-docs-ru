## Overview
This proposal aims to dilute the amount of Syndicate agents on the station by adding more variety to it. Instead, bad actors will infiltrate the Space Station 14 from many other places.
From intelligence agencies to religious fanatics and lone task force operatives - almost everyone needs something that Nanotrasen has.

> “Either you are with us, or you are already dead in five minutes. It’s not up to you.”

> Allegiances and additional notes are recommendations. You do not have to strictly follow them.

## New bosses
Now every traitor have a "boss", that asks you complete some objective. No matter what boss you have, you always have random objectives.

Animal Rights Consortium and Bee Liberation Front are save animals from the iron grasp of Nanotrasen! However, butcher and killing sometimes is a small price to save more lives!

MI13 intelligence agency and not corporate saboteurs. However, some tasks have to be done by traitor's hands!

Gorlex Marauders are famous marauders in galaxy, getting noticed is not an issue. However, carrying out a massacre is bad even for their reputation!

Donk Co. and Waffle Co. ridiculously huge corporations, and are not very friends with each other. However, the potential revenue always came first!

And so on and so on.

## Traitor changes
Only text description, some names syndicate changed to traitor (more appropriate). No discounts and no somethin "game changi".

## Why?
More lore, and by that player's possibilities to act with people in more interesting way and encourage players to interact with each other and creates a great start topic, or "initial kick" for them. Adding factions (basically, just text description) will have a great impact on making traitors feel like they're part of something bigger.
- Why you kill somebody? Because I'm from Gorlax, and I could and would spread my name!
- Why I steal? Because I work on underground corporation that like to get NT techs!
- Why I need to steal korgi?! Because we bees and save animals!
Players should not think too much why their "bosses" would kill, steal and so on, so they don't restrictions, but wouldn't it be amazing have "the boss"? Totally.
