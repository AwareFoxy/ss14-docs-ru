## Overview
This proposal aims to dilute the amount of Syndicate agents on the station by adding more variety to it. Instead, bad actors will infiltrate the Space Station 14 from many other places.
From intelligence agencies to religious fanatics and lone task force operatives - almost everyone needs something that Nanotrasen has.

## Objectives changes
Depending on your "boss", you will have a higher or a lower chance of rolling a certain objective, or even not get it at all, this also applies to either escaping on the shuttle alive or dying a glorious death.

Animal Rights Consortium and Bee Liberation Front would never want their activists to butcher Ian, instead you would get an objective of stealing an animal, because that's what they do - save animals from the iron grasp of Nanotrasen!

MI13 would never want you to kill anyone, because they're an intelligence agency and not corporate saboteurs.

Gorlex Marauders would not want you to steal a CMO's hypospray, because they already have one of their own.

Donk Co. and Waffle Co. are not very friends with each other, thus their agents get a higher chance of being tasked with killing an agent of the enemy corporation.

And so on and so on.

## Uplink changes
Only text description change for lore purposes. No discounts. No fun.

## Why?
More lore, and by that player's possibilities to act with people in more interesting way and encourage players to interact with each other and creates a great start topic, or "initial kick" for them. Adding factions (basically, just text description) will have a great impact on making traitors feel like they're part of something bigger.
- Why you kill somebody? Because it's my faction, and I have to spread my name!
- Why I steal? Because I work on underground corporation that like to get NT techs!
- Why I need to steal korgi?! Because we bees and save animals!
