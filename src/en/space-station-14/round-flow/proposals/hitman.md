## Overview

This proposal describes a new minor antagonist - hitman.
Hitman specializes in stealthy, often non-conventional eliminations using intel and tools that can be mostly found on-station.

## Main Design Points

Hitman, of course, needs to be different from a traitor with kill objectives. Here are the main points that differentiate hitman from other antagonists:

- Hitman is made with stealth in mind. Going loud as a hitman should be heavily discouraged, although making *some* noise is totally acceptable as a distraction.
- Preparation is a very important part in hitman's gameloop. Without proper preparation, achieving objectives as a hitman should be very difficult. Safehouse mechanic aims to achieve that.
- Targets are not known by a hitman directly. Instead, hitman is supposed to gather clues and match them with contractor intel. This encourages more roleplaying, because some clues can be easily gained through it.
- Instead of getting things via uplink/toolbox, hitman is encouraged to use things that are available on the station for everyone, but in a creative way. However, some items can still be unique to hitman, but only obtainable as an option from the Safehouse.

## Objectives

Hitman has following objectives:

- Kill a target. (Optional) Follow specific conditions.
- Do not kill anyone except the targets.
- Exfiltrate alive and unrestrained.

There may be from 2 to 4 targets. The total number of objectives related to killing a target is around 4-5, including the optionals. This may result in 4 targets without any optionals, or 2 targets with 2 and 1 optional task each, and so on.

Certain optional kill methods imply sabotage. In order to prevent situations like "I plasmaflooded the entire station because I needed to burn my target", objective "Do not kill anyone except the targets" exists. It should display the amount of non-targets killed in order to differentiate between a loud hitman (which is bad!) and a hitman that, for example, killed a validhunter.

Exfiltration is the same as traitor objective.

## Target Clues

Hitman starts at a safe location - the Safehouse. There, Hitman gains the initial intel about objectives and prepares for deployment.

For every individual target, a codename is generated, and 2-3 clues are given about each target in a form of a paper. Clues may be:

- Species;
- Department;
- A trait;
- A marking;
- A trinket that target has picked in their loadout;
- Approximate age;
- Pronouns;
- Part of DNA sequence;
- Part of fingerprint sequence.

Some of these clues imply that you could get access to a departmental computer, such as station records or medical records, in order to use the clues at maximum effiency.

## Safehouse

In Safehouse, hitman can also pick items needed for the task.

Hitman gets the following items as starting gear:

- Agent ID. This is a must-have item, because disguises are very important to hitman;
- A single job loadout of their choosing, including PDA with ID. Hitman has to join the station as if any other character would. Of course, this is limited to non-command and security;
- Cobra. A hitman is not a hitman without a silenced pistol;
- Thief gloves. Stealing stuff from people, such as ID cards for access, is pretty much impossible to do in stealth without these.

Hitman can also pick 2 items from this list:

- Jaws of life
- Voice mask
- Hypopen
- Chameleon projector
- Stealth box (must add the variant that can be packed into a bag in order to take it out of the Safehouse)
- Radio jammer

When hitman is ready, they can leave the safehouse via one-way portal, which transfers them to arrivals.

## Example Objectives

Some examples of optional kill methods:
- Decompression (target must die from spacing in depressurized environment);
- Poison (toxic atmos also works);
- Radiation;
- Explosion (target must at least go crit from an explosion);
- Gun execution.

Some examples of optional conditions:
- While wearing a cloak;
- While concealing your true identity;
- While target is in space;
- Corpse must be incinerated;
- Corpse must stay on station.
