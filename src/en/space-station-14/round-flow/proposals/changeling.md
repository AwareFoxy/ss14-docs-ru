## Overview
A rare space creature with absolute control over its biology, mind over the flesh, or something like that. The changeling is the apex predator of all sentient life, feeding on their genomes and biomass to sustain its ever-shifting body. The station is the changeling's hunting ground, and the crew is its prey. It acts as a lone hunter, it doesn't collaborate with anyone, even other changelings, and it wouldn't hesitate to kill and feast on its own kind.
The changeling is a roundstart opt-in role like traitor, it starts disguised as the player's regular character with the assumption that while off-station the changeling quietly captured and devoured them, posing as them to get onto the station to further its survival. Changelings always have a single objective. **survive** and make it to centcom. Its restraint status is irrelevant, it just needs to be alive.

The goal of this version of the changeling is to create a terrifying roundstart antagonist, taking advantage of body horror elements to assimilate the crew into itself. The changeling will regularly round remove people to sustain its murder spree, and its own failure will round remove it as a result.

## BIOMASS
The changeling begins the round with around 150 biomass, this biomass depletes by 1 every 12 seconds or so. Biomass is a changeling's way of sustaining its body and abilities, without enough biomass, a changeling will wither and die. The only way to increase the amount of biomass a changeling has is to consume bodies. Consuming one person will grant the changeling 100 biomass, this means a changeling can survive for 20 minutes without using abilities for every person it devours. Rotting corpses cannot be devoured for biomass, and bloated corpses cannot be devoured for DNA.

A single changeling without the use of eyeslugs should round-remove somewhere around 4 people purely to survive, even more if it uses abilities. A loud changeling that doesn't die might eat a quarter of the crew by the time the shuttle docks at centcomm.

### HUNGER
A changeling will always be able to see its biomass count in place of its hunger status on the right side of the screen, and as this number lowers various negative effects occur such as...
- Hunger will start with the changeling getting pop-up notifications that it's feeling hungry, its form rumbles, and its blood feels thin. No effects yet.

- Hunger will continue with the changeling exhibiting outwardly visible symptoms such as coughing up blood, twitching, or having bloodshot eyes. Generally off-putting stuff that lets people know something is wrong without directly giving away that this is a changeling.

- As hunger becomes more and more of a problem, more severe and obvious side-effects will occur, such as spasms, vomiting up large pools of blood, and other horrific stuff. These effects will alert the changeling that they are oncoming and would not be frequent, but if seen would tip off knowledgable crew that something is dangerous about their coworker, leading to them reporting it to security. Knowing these effects are from a changeling shouldn't be considered metagaming, but there should be other sources for these effects such as a disease.

- Once a changeling's biomass runs so low that it can no longer sustain itself, it goes into a frenzy. The changeling will collapse onto the ground with an obvious popup visible to everyone nearby which tells the room what's going on, and then the changeling, no longer able to keep up the disguise, will unleash its true form in a last-ditch effort to get a meal.

- A starving true form cannot revert into a humanoid form until it has consumed enough to stabilize itself, which would generally be a single fresh corpse, if it does not eat, it will take constant damage until it dies. The starving changeling still has costs to abilities but can use them regardless of whether it has enough biomass or not. Entering greater negative biomass simply accelerates the speed at which the changeling takes damage. If a starving changeling dies for any reason, whether that be bullets or well, starving, it will wither away into a pile of bloody bones and dust. Entirely unrevivable and removed from the round.


## ABILITIES
The changeling starts with a few free abilities and can unlock more at the cost of biomass.

**NAME | UNLOCK COST | USE COST | NEEDED FORM**

#### FREE ABILITIES
The changeling, in its weakest state, is still able to do some pretty nasty stuff. These abilities are central to the changeling's functionality and it can never not have them.

- **Transform | free | low | disguised**

The changeling uses a small amount of biomass to change its outward appearance and vocal cords using the DNA of someone it has absorbed. The trademark ability of the changeling.


- **Devour | free | free | any**

The changeling scrapes out the insides of a corpse and feasts on it, integrating the bloody chunks into itself and storing the DNA for later use. The corpse will have all organs (including its brain) removed and it will be turned into a "husk" which cannot be revived or identified by examination. This spills blood everywhere in the process and shreds any jumpsuit the victim was wearing, so the changeling must make sure to take it off if it hopes to wear it.
If the changeling devours another changeling, it will immediately be made aware of this, it will gain all of the enemy changeling's biomass in addition to the normal amount it would gain, as well as all of the dead changeling's unlocked abilities and DNA strands.


- **Stasis | free | low | any**

A changeling will enter a "dead" state and slowly recover its wounds to eventually revive itself. If a changeling is rendered dead, it can activate this ability at any time to recover. A changeling's corpse will never rot, but it will display freshness amounts to the crew up to nearly rotting. This ability cannot be used while starving.


- **Shed | free | free | disguised**

The changeling sheds its humanoid disguise and becomes its true form, breaking free of any restraints and restoring its stamina. The true form still has access to all the changeling's abilities. It has around 200 EHP and always has an armblade active however only has one free hand to manipulate the world with. A changeling will be forced into its true form if its biomass ever drops to or below zero.
Though using this seems cheap, the real cost of using this ability comes when the changeling seeks to re-mask itself.


- **Mask | free | high | true**

Replaces Shed while in true form. The changeling in its true form disguises itself using one of the DNA strains it has access to for a relatively high amount of biomass. This ability cannot be used while starving.


## HIVEMIND
The changeling can choose to integrate minds into itself instead of simply devouring them. This is useful for retaining personalities or quickly allowing minions to be controlled. All beings including the changeling that are within a hivemind can speak to each other using :h.
Absorbed minds are forced to follow any orders given by the changeling, and griefing the changeling would be extremely rule-breaking.

- **Hivemind | medium | free | any**
The changeling warps its mind to allow for multiple beings to be stored within. Using this ability will show a radial menu which allows the changeling to use any of the abilities listed under this HIVEMIND section. Once hivemind is unlocked, all hivemind abilities are unlocked and do not need to be purchased separately.


- **Absorption | medium | free | any**

The changeling toggles whether devouring someone will cause them to be absorbed into their hivemind, or simply destroyed. An absorbed mind is only a shadow of its original self, it is at the changeling's mercy, and can no longer feel for the people it once cared for.


- **Relinquish** | medium | free | disguised**

The changeling will grant control over its body to one of the minds it has absorbed. The mind will not be able to enter the changeling's true form, and if it somehow manages to, the changeling will immediately regain control.


- **Restrict** | medium | free | disguised**

The changeling toggles whether minds can use abilities while in control of the changeling's body. Useful if you suspect the players are salty about dying.


- **Retake** | medium | free | disguised**

The changeling instantly retakes control from a mind.


- **Purge** | medium | free | disguised**

The changeling erases an absorbed mind from itself, kicking it out into the afterlife.


- **Emancipation | medium | free | any**

Opens a radial menu allowing the changeling to select a mind that will instantly inhabit the next minion spawned. Using this ability again before a minion is spawned will cancel it.


#### STEALTH
The changeling in a disguised state shouldn't be entirely under the radar. The crew would know there is SOMETHING among them, picking them off, hunting. The changeling's stealth abilities should allow it to remain out of sight while killing, and allow it to deceive the crew and make them feel safe, or throw them off the trail.

- **Mimic | medium | low | disguised**

The changeling modifies its voice to that of anyone it so chooses, it does not require someone's DNA to mimic their voice.


- **Chameleon | medium | low | disguised**

The changeling grows out biological clothing to cover its skin. It can change the appearance of this clothing while wearing it. Anyone can remove or wear the clothing, but only changelings can modify it. The clothing can be tested by cutting it into cloth, which will yield fleshy strips instead of regular material. This clothing gives the changeling a jumpsuit, shoes, gloves, a hat, a mask, and a backpack. The backpack can change shape into a duffel back or a satchel, and any items inside that cannot fit once it changes will fall to the ground.


- **Lesser | medium | medium | any**

The changeling shrinks into a monkey or kobold, retaining any clothing that a monkey can wear and dropping anything else as well as freeing itself from cuffs. In this form, the changeling can ventcrawl, but is only able to use the stasis, shed, and transform abilities.


- **Imprint | low | low | disguised**

The changeling shifts the shape of its fingerprints to that of any DNA it has access to, the chosen fingerprint will stay the same regardless of the current disguise.


- **Mindshield | medium | low | disguised**

The changeling instantly shifts its internal composition to falsely appear mindshielded to anyone wearing a security HUD. Using this ability again toggles the shield.


#### STINGERS
The changeling's stinger can inject its prey with various chemicals to weaken or confuse them, with a mixture of effective stealth and combat uses. Other changelings are immune to these chemicals.

- **Stinger | low | low | disguised**

The changeling discreetly transforms its currently active arm into a stinger, if it is holding something in that arm it will use the other arm, and if it's holding something in both arms it will drop its currently held item. This stinger is not visible on examination, sprites, or in strip menus, but the changeling cannot use the stinger as a hand. The changeling can use the stinger inhand to open a radial menu to select the chemical it wishes to inject, and it injects by clicking on a target. Chemicals are unlocked as their own upgrades, but cannot be used without the stinger ability.


- **Tailsting | low | medium | any**

The changeling quite blatantly grows a large tail with a sharp stinger at the end, acting as a "third arm" of sorts. This stinger injects differently from the arm stinger, requiring the changeling to hit its target with the tail for a small amount of piercing damage, and triggering a very obvious popup to the person injected. The tail stinger injects twice as many chemicals as the arm stinger, and is visible on the changeling's sprite and when it is examined.


- **Gibberizol | low | low | stinger**

A chemical that prevents targets from talking in any understandable language for an extended duration. Everything they say will come out as garbled nonsense, though they will still be able to yell out over the radio, potentially putting the crew on high alert if the changeling doesn't down its prey quickly enough. The target will not know they have been stung until they attempt to speak.


- **Mute-agen | low | medium | stinger**

A chemical that prevents targets from talking at all for a duration. The perfect chemical for preventing prey from crying out for help over common. The target will feel a painful sting when this chemical is injected.


- **Impedrezol | medium | medium | stinger**

A chemical that slows targets down to half their regular walking speed, making escaping from or fleeing the changeling nearly impossible. This does not stun, freeze, or damage the target.


- **Hallucinol | medium | medium | stinger**

A powerful hallucinogenic substance that will give a person the trip of their life, slightly slow their movement, and have the secondary effect of entirely preventing them from metabolizing other chemicals while this one is present in their bloodstream.


- **Chitizene | medium | high | stinger**

The target is injected with a genetics-changing substance which, following a delay of around 30 seconds, transforms their arm into a changeling blade. The blade causes them to drop items they were holding in that hand, and is not as effective as a true blade, but can still reasonably damage squishy unarmored targets. The blade will revert to normal after around 8 minutes, or when the victim dies.


- **Licoxide | high | high | stinger**

The target is injected with a chemical that causes them to be periodically shocked, stunning them for a short duration and causing them to drop any held items. The target will feel a painful sting when this chemical is injected.


#### MINIONS
The changeling can create all sorts of horrors from its ever-shifting mass of biological matter. These generally take the form of detached body parts. All of the changeling's minions except for the headcrab are ghost roles with a short raffle. Ghost role minions cannot verbally speak, but can silently communicate with the changeling that created it as if it were wearing a headset. The headcrab can speak to people.

- **Eyeslug | high | low | any**

One of the changeling's eyes falls out and rapidly regrows, creating a bloody eyeslug that can go under doors, ventcrawl, be picked up, and only has 5 HP. If the eyeslug ever comes across a stunned or critical humanoid, it can burrow into their face, killing the eyeslug and infecting them with a disease shortly after that causes the humanoid to slowly exhibit symptoms of a starving changeling, but without the changeling's ability to recover from them quickly. The longer the humanoid has this disease, the more biomass a changeling will acquire upon devouring them. A dead humanoid can be infected but will not progress the infection until they're revived.


- **Handspider | low | medium | any**

The changeling's currently active hand falls off and rapidly regrows, dropping their held item and creating a handspider that moves quickly and can ventcrawl but cannot directly damage people. The handspider can jump onto people's faces to stun them for around 5 seconds, this ability has a long cooldown and leaves the handspider stuck in place for the duration of that stun. The handspider cannot stun people wearing a face-covering helmet or mask unless the mask is cosmetic such as the clown mask.


- **Legworm | medium | high | disguised**

One of the changeling's legs falls off and gradually regrows, rendering the changeling unable to walk for around 15 seconds and creating a Legworm. The legworm is a relatively bulky fighter that can assist the changeling in combat, dealing fair blunt damage on m1 and being able to disarm on m2, but it is not extremely mobile and dies quickly in one-on-one fights.


- **Chitinworm | medium | high | true**

Replaces the Legworm ability when in true form, and does not cost extra to unlock once the legworm can be used. Replaces the 15-second stun with a 15-second slowdown and creates a much more deadly Chitinworm, a variation of the legworm with a bit more health that also deals extra slash damage on hit.


- **Headcrab | medium | free | any**

An absolute last resort for a changeling that has been incapacitated and cannot rejuvenate itself.  The changeling's head detaches over the course of about 20 seconds, leaving behind its body and turning into an angry crab with a single goal: Survive. The headcrab can ventcrawl, moves at the same speed as a human, and is quite fragile with around 20 HP. It can stun like the handspider and deals low slashing damage when it attacks. If the headcrab finds or makes a dead|critical person, it can burrow into them and, after around a minute, take control and live again. A changeling will usually be in a dead body by the time they take control, so they'll be forced to use stasis until they can repair their wounds, or until a clueless doctor revives them. Once a changeling takes control of a body, they will lose all their unlocked abilities, and only be left with 50 biomass. This ability cannot be used while starving.
If a headcrab dies the changeling is fully dead, regardless of if their body is still intact. A headcrab CAN be revived, but why would anyone do that? A dead headcrab can be picked up and is a medium item, grinding it nets you enough chitizene to use a false armblade for a minute


#### COMBAT
Combat abilities are mostly only available to a changeling in its true form, with the exception of the arm blade as a method of fighting while still in disguise.

- **Armblade | medium | medium | disguised**

The changeling, after a large red popup visible to everyone nearby and a short doafter which cannot be interrupted by external means, transforms its currently active arm into a large and obvious weapon, dropping any items it was holding in that hand. This weapon cannot be dropped or removed by other people, and will only disappear when the changeling dies or uses this ability again. The armblade is very effective as a melee weapon and will easily win the changeling one-on-one encounters, but falls short in more extended fights against multiple people, or in the case the enemy has stuns. This ability is free to use while an armblade is active.


- **Rejuvinate | medium | very high | true**

The changeling expends a very large amount of biomass to rapidly repair its body through a 5-second doafter. The amount of biomass needed scales with the severity of the changeling's wounds. If the changeling does not have enough biomass to entirely heal itself, it will expend biomass into the negatives, causing it to begin starving. The changeling can use this ability regardless of form if it is dead or critical, and if the changeling is not in its true form while dead or critical, it will enter its true form when the ability is used. The changeling will instantly die if it attempts to use this while starving.
Intended as a last resort for a loud changeling that has been utterly cornered and is about to be gibbed/cremated.


- **Shriek | high | medium | true**

The changeling screeches loudly, causing any non-changeling in a radius to instantly take 55 stamina damage, slowing them and either allowing the changeling to follow up with an attack or use it as a method of escaping a bad situation using the slowdown from stamina.


## REQUIRED CHANGES
- Salvage corpses now spawn very bloated. They cannot be consumed by the changeling for food.
- Add ventcrawling for mice, rats, etc.
- Some implementation of virology for the eyeslug infection and for early starvation symptoms to not be metagamed.
