## Overview

Adds a new antagonist who looks a bit like the rat king. More details in PR

## Background

You can write your question here or something related to the antagonist - https://github.com/space-wizards/space-station-14/pull/30820

## The rest?

The antagonist will not be very strong, for example, a guard spider can be killed with just a crowbar, but if they are together and in a lair with a web that slows down victims, they are strong.
They play through base building and constant expansion. The goal of the spider queen is to reproduce and increase the size of the lair.

About the PR
Queen abilities:

— Laying eggs (4 pieces).
— Summons three small spiders that disappear after 20 seconds.
— Create a wall of web, the web itself and a blue crystal for lighting.

Spiders:

— Spider Queen (the strongest unit, although it is not difficult to kill, so it relies on its children and laid eggs).
— Spider Hunter (the main force of the hive, the best bite).
— Spider Guard (can build walls and webs with crystals).
— Ghost Spider (has invisibility, deals poison damage and injects a sleeping reagent).
— Spider Shooter (shoots poison, hits with poison)

You could say that it will be similar to the Rat King, only the servants will be players. They, as a rule, do not attack themselves, but simply create problems in technical rooms. You can kill one spider with a crowbar, their strength is in the web and unity!

Right now it's not 100% ready, at least the description is normal, the names and distribution into folders are necessary, but the gameplay is all there, so you can take a look and say what to change or something like that.

He appears in the ventilation as the king of rats.

Why / Balance
The new antagonist is fun!
