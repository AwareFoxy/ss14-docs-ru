## Languages and Game Impact

I will firstly like to adress the point of adding languages at all. Languages allow for new RP opportunities and even game balance. Languages first and foremost will serve as a new way for SS14 players to express themselves, and communicate with each other. In terms of game balance, this allows for all kinds of antags to properly communicate without revealing crucial information or setting unbelievable situations. My exmaples for communication and expression would be a slimeperson being able to talk to Smile the slime, or Vox talking their native tongue together in an nitrogren enviroment. Languages are powerful tools for feeling a connection, species specific languages foster kinship between crew of the same species as well as open new RP opportunities. On the second point, for example, carp could now speak with their dragon leader thru xeno-common. Traitors would be more willing to work together and coordinate through the use of their unique codespeak. I can imagine in the future heretics of some sort, or any cult themed gamemode/antag, making great use of languages in an antag sense likewise. It should be possible to within a round, learn to understand a language, but perhaps not learn to speak it. Although learning to speak it should not be impossible neither, simply something that must be worked towards specifically or get lucky due to circumstance. 

## Languages and you

Listed below are the common languages, languages that can be found roundstart spoken by cognitive and sentient creatures.
Mind you to anyone who cannot understand the language, it will appear as random chains of ununderstandable words.

| Native Speaker | Language Name | Language description |
|---|---|---|
| NT Crew | Galactic Common | Sounds like a combination of Mandarin Chinese and various forms of Spanish |

## The rest?

Is entirely up to you.
