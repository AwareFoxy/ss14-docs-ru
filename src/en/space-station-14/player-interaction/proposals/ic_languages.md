## Languages and Game Impact

I will firstly like to adress the point of adding languages at all. Languages allow for new RP opportunities and even game balance. Languages first and foremost will serve as a new way for SS14 players to express themselves, and communicate with each other. In terms of game balance, this allows for all kinds of antags to properly communicate without revealing crucial information or setting unbelievable situations. My exmaples for communication and expression would be a slimeperson being able to talk to Smile the slime, or Vox talking their native tongue together in an nitrogren enviroment. Languages are powerful tools for feeling a connection, species specific languages foster kinship between crew of the same species as well as open new RP opportunities. On the second point, for example, carp could now speak with their dragon leader thru xeno-common. Traitors would be more willing to work together and coordinate through the use of their unique codespeak. I can imagine in the future heretics of some sort, or any cult themed gamemode/antag, making great use of languages in an antag sense likewise. It should be possible to within a round, learn to understand a language, but perhaps not learn to speak it. Although learning to speak it should not be impossible neither, simply something that must be worked towards specifically or get lucky due to circumstance. 

## Languages and you

Listed below are the common languages, languages that can be found roundstart spoken by cognitive and sentient creatures.
Mind you to anyone who cannot understand the language, it will appear as random chains of ununderstandable words. Language descriptions are solely based on what real life languages or sounds (onomatopoeias) will be used to generate the garbled mess players who do not understand the language will see.

| Native Speaker | Language Name | Language description |
|---|---|---|
| NT Crew | Galactic Common | Sounds like a combination of Mandarin Chinese and various forms of Spanish |
| Humans | Galactic Uncommon | Sounds like a combination of Russian and English |
| Lizard-People | Draconic | Sounds Nordic with aspects of hisses, rattles and snorts added |
| Moth-People | Moffic | Sounds like humming, with mixed in chittering and squeaks |
| Arachnids | Aranean | Sounds like Latin with aspects of clicking |
| Slime-People | Geran | Sounds like bubbling, popping, and squishing |
| Dwarves | Dwarven | Sounds like gaelic |
| Diona | Rootspeak | Sounds like whistling, creaking, and snapping |
| Vox | Vox-Pidgin | Sounds like shrieking, cooing, and cawing (as in the sound a crow makes) |

Next is a list of uncommon languages that you may find being spoken on station although not by any crew.

| Native Speaker | Language Name | Language description |
|---|---|---|
| Mice, Mothroaches, critters, staion pets | Animalisch | Sounds like generic animal sounds |
| Monkies | Apeish | Sounds like yelling and common monkey sounds |
| Silicons and Synthetics | Encoded Audio Language | Sounds electric buzzing and occasionals beeps |

Next is a list of antagonistic languages, hearing someone speaking any of these sound be concerning...

| Native Speaker | Language Name | Language description |
|---|---|---|
| The Syndicate | Codespeak | Sounds like random words from Galactic Common |
| Xenos, Carp, Salv-mobs, Dragons | Xeno-Common | Sounds like gargling, gutteral yells and backwards Galactic Common |
| Heretics/Cultists | Shadow Tongue | Sounds like long strings of completely random words from every language |
| Heretics/Cultists | Nar'sian | You know how people sound when they drink Cogchamp? Just that. |


## How the hell do I even speak my mother tongue?

There is two ways to do it, the easy way for short conversations or for just saying one sentence is to add the proper prefix before what you are saying, for example: :c ,m I am speaking over command comms in moffric!. Alternatively for speaking for long amounts of time, using a radial button and key exactly like emotes, you can choose your default languge. This is the language you will speak in when not specifying with a comma and character.
