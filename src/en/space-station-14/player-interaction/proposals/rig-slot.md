## Overview

Add an additional inventory slot and adjust the rest of inventory to achieve a more dynamic system. The rig slot is an upper body parallel to the belt slot. Together, the belt slot and the rig slot form a task-oriented "front inventory" while changes to back bags form a spacious "back inventory".

## Background

This proposal is contextualized by the state of the game when suit storage was changed to not be provided by coats and jackets. In my opinion the change was positive, and it inspired some additional thoughts regarding inventory.

This proposal is not a response to this change but some of its concepts are inspired by it.

## The New Slot: The Rig Slot
As previously stated, the rig slot is an upper-body parallel to the belt slot. Together, their similar roles but unique identities expand the concept of a character's loadout, forming a two-part "task inventory".

This task inventory varies depending on your job and gameplay goals:
- A 'construction' loadout may feature a material sheet bag in the belt slot and a tool rig in the rig slot.
- A 'salvaging' loadout may feature an ore bag in the belt slot and a salvage rig in the rig slot.
- A 'combat' loadout may feature a grenade belt in the belt slot and a shoulder holster in the rig slot.

By expanding the concept of a task-oriented inventory (particularly in combination with additional proposals below) from single supplementary options to capable multi-part loadouts, role identity is given more to define itself with. By letting users mix and match the upper and lower half of their loadout, their role belt does not have to be a catch-all for their needed equipment, their gear does not all have to fit in one place, and characters can mix and match the strengths of their roles.

As an example of the first, for a nuclear operative currently, pistols can fit in the grenadier rig, which thematically is suppose to be a rig where an operative stores their wealth of explosives. The argument that maybe that just shouldnt be the case does not weigh on this proposal, but the point is illustrating that limited loadout customization compels options to reach outside of their niche.

As an example of the second, tool belts can fit pretty much every tool an engineer could ever need, and this power to carry a complete set of tools and gadgets is commonly available. Instead, this full capacity could be split between a two-part set, a tool belt and a tool rig, one being more limited to engineer access, representing their "tool proficiency".

As an example of the third, a combat medic could wear a belt full of medical supplies and stims and a rig to store their weapon of choice. They are not as combat oriented as their allies, but they have both medical and combat powers.

Role identity can be about ability to carry equipment just as much as it is about accessing that equipment. It comes up in discussion sometimes that players can be deincentivized to include other players in a task in favor of just borrowing their equipment. To use the example of a dangerous expedition, salvage doesnt need to recruit an armed guard when they can just own their own weapons. With a greater emphasis on the value of task inventories over generic inventories, it becomes that character's are oriented towards different sets of goals.

On that note, most loadouts have an explicit initial step where the abilities of a role-defining slot, like the belt, are 'declared' by equipping a belt that represents a particular proficiency, like declaring a construction role by equipping a tool belt. Combat loadouts depend on their choice of weapon, yet despite this, no declaration of a combat role has to be made to carry a weapon directly in the role define slot. Rather than having role define slots like the belt (and the proposed rig) need to declare their powers before use, a dilemma involving heavy inventory sacrifice currently attempts to balance the ability to carry weapons for everyone. The captain gets a cool sabre sheath that makes the sword belt equippable where it otherwise isnt, and the captain loves wearing it because it's incredibly cool.

## Back Bag Changes

To state it up front, nothing in design can compare to a spacious, completely generic, effortlessy accessible inventory granted to every player. These three qualities together complicate any effort to design strong role identity or dynamic inventory-management decisions. Bags have far too much value centered in one place. 

As a result of bags,

- supporting utility inventories lack the utility value that they thematically boast, being only small boosts in specific directions to the player's total capacity. Besides localizing a certain type of item in one place on a person, they do little to present interesting dynamics. Only after something doesnt fit in the bag does it go to players' other options, including seldom used storage like coats.

- players cannot gain informed expectations about interactions with others. Using an example of a security search, currently a suspect being stopped has perfect access to anything in their backpack, including a gun, without telegraphing this danger at all. It is a consistent interest in SS14 design to mitigate the demand for high reflexes in a game where many other players can act on you at any time. Not being able to understand what a character is capable of is a clarity issue and can create a paranoia in common character interactions.

- decisions that are intended to be compelling are difficult to justify, like giving up what is nearly your sole inventory to carry a weapon on your back. Your backpack is far too spacious, universal, and accessible, holding your personal survival equipment at round start, to match most weapons' value, which in some cases will require additional carried resources like ammo.

### The Two Proposals
There are two alternative proposals for changes to back spaces:

1) The first proposal is that back bags can no longer be opened while worn, instead being opened in-hand or on the ground. This excludes the satchel, which now has a small capacity fitting of its form and can be opened while worn.

Many games stop you in some way when you go to access the complete gallery of your entire inventory. It might open a menu that spans the whole screen, it might restrict some of your controls, etc. For some helpful example, think about what a high-value manuever weapon-swapping in a Dark Souls game is, and how appropriately restricted it is by its equipment menu. We have no such obstacles (besides the hilariously large bluespace bag grids), and you remain full actionable, so effortlessly actionable that you could leave your center inventory open at all times. In a hand-based game, I think involving the hands in this proposed 'obstacle' is appropriate.

2) The second proposal is that back bags have a do-after for transferring items in and out, again specifically while worn. This also excludes the satchel, which would have no do-after while worn, or at least a shorter one. In this proposal's case, the inventory can infact be opened and viewed while worn.

This is a friendlier version of the first proposal. It preserves its intention and loosens its limitations. For one, it retains clarity, since a player can still see into their bag and remind themselves of its contents like they currently can. It also retains ease of controls, not having to remove the bag and move between hands to open it and interface with the contents, but still being able to.

### Intended Experience

With either of these changes to bags, the intended experience is that players will have their most frequently accessed and important items in their "front inventory", like a form of cache. Likewise it's also the intention that in some jobs, additional resources from their "back inventory" are brought forward into their cache between tasks. The intended loop in this regard is that the front inventory defines a character's abilities per task, their back inventory defines a character's total capacity to complete tasks, and so players enter a rythm of completing a task, bringing resources forward a number of times, and then returning to their department to totally refresh.

For a constuction loadout, they may bring additional materials forward into their cache after a repair. After a certain set of repairs, they would go to Engineering or Cargo to restock.

For a combat loadout, they may bring additional ammo and gear forward into their cache after an encounter. After a certain number of violent encounters, they would take time away from danger to restock their arsenal.

It is also intended that the changes to bags be as low friction as possible while being enough to set this clear distinction between a task-oriented accessible inventory and a spacious universal inventory. Holding a bag in a hand or opening it on the ground is not a massive hurdle, and if players wish to bypass it, they have a dedicated inventory option with the satchel. Many players operate in a specific spot for an extended period, it might even become natural that they place their bag down once they get to their workstation, like most would in daily work. 

If they are instead a job that moves about the station alot, handheld storage options like toolboxes might even get more use, since they can easily be opened in your hand or placed down at your site of work. In this case, you could tote around a small work station and place it down without needing to mix those work tools with your personal belongings or having to make your belongings vulnerable. The difference in ease of access highlights and motivates this distinction.

## Supporting Proposals

- Most longarms can no longer fit in back bags at all.
- Most sidearms can no longer fit in pocket slots. (Filed-down pocket-pistols like the cobra could.)
- Remove weapons' ability to be worn like clothes and grant that capacity to combat oriented belts and rigs. (If compensation for loss of crew power is needed, civilian options for slings and holsters, with bare minimum capacity, can be added.)
- Restrict suit storage to space suits and to storing oxygen.

Currently if all slots possible were used to carry weapons, assuming someone had any kind of armor at all, a person could wear 2 long arms and 3 sidearms. Many games follow a rule of "one big one small", and standard weapon wearing should resemble this.

"One small" could hang in a worn belt and "one large" could sling on a worn rig. Or you could wear a belt holster and a shoulder holster and take two smalls with you instead. Combat-specialized loadouts would allow this holstering while providing some additional space for ammo and gear in the belt/rig. The decision to wear weapons now explicitly leans a character into being a combat loadout, compromising their other abilities.

Said briefly, the final above proposal to restrict suit storage is because with this new addition, its old niches would be covered, and the slot can focus on a space-faring suit's built-in capacity for an oxygen tank.
