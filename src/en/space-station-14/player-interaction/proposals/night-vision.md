## Overview

adds night vision, which is a dimly lit area around the character that only he sees.

## How it work

using the new client-side system, which will be inherited from the Shared Point Light System, add a very dim light source that only the client sees. 
for people, this is 1 tile, which only allows you to see yourself on the screen in order to somehow navigate.
dwarves can see on 2-3 tiles
lizards by 3-4 tiles
xenomorphs by 10 tiles
animals by 3-4 tiles

## Why

What is it for? well, first of all, so that spiders, xenomorphs, rats and other creatures can use the absence of light as an advantage. secondly, to remove the unpleasant moment when you can't banally understand where you are simply because everything is black. 
Thirdly, it can become a springboard for new roles whose game will be to hide in the shadows
