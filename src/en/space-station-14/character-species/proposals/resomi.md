## Overview

This change adds a new race that is very different from the standard humanoids. Firstly, resomi are small in stature (just over a meter) and have a completely different body shape. their lore, structure and features, in general, are described on this wiki page https://avali.fandom.com/wiki/The_Official_Avali_Wiki and the mechanics are copied from this build https://github.com/infinitystation/Baystation12

## Features

they have only 70% of the health of an ordinary person (due to their small size)

Their blood is purple

the glare from the flashes affects them 2 times longer, and the screen turns white instead of black (I see this as correct, since it is necessary to demonstrate the high sensitivity of their eyes, and those who do not like it may simply not play on this race.  background changes only apply to this race)

They hear whispers at a distance of 3-5 meters

They have an active ability that allows them to ignore tables and similar obstacles.

They have night vision, which illuminates an area of 3-5 meters for them. 

they are small, which means they cannot effectively use large-caliber weapons. there will be a high spread for them, regardless of whether they hold it in one hand or not

they can be picked up, as they are small. this takes time and, of course, the player will be notified about this and will be able to easily interrupt the process if not connected. in order to take it, you will need to click on the resomi when you hold it with ctrl + click (when the capture system is added, it will depend on it)

## Review

A pretty enough race that will have both very strong disadvantages and significant advantages. They are poor direct fighters as they have less health and cannot use serious weapons, but they are maneuverable with their ability to calmly overcome tables. from the point of view of RP, resomi at the mechanic level are limited in illegal actions (no one wants to get a white screen from a flash), and their good lore and a large number of avali fans who will play on this race and will win back their collectivism contributes to a high level of RP
