## Overview

Avalis are a relatively well known open species of avians. They are smaller then standard humans at around 1-1.2 meters. The general lore and features are described on the [Avali wiki](https://avali.fandom.com/wiki/The_Official_Avali_Wiki).

## Background

They exist by different names on Space Station 13 and there has been quite a bit of interest in adding them, there has also been previous implementation attempts that I have taken inspiration from [Resomi](https://github.com/space-wizards/docs/pull/266).

The Scope as discussed in the species discussion would fit in a role as follows:
"Minor mechanics": A species with some gameplay implications but not major and "Support": Low damage potential, utility benefits

## The rest?

Is entirely up to you.



## Features
