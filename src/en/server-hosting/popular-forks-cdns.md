```admonish danger
All forks listed here (Exept Wizard's Den) are **not vetted**. We only just put the links in a convinient place.

Third party server builds are not affiliated with the project, and have the same risks as running any random executable off the internet. Only run software that you trust.

FAQ:

- The fork I want is not listed here.
	- You will need to contact the fork you want a server build for and ask them if they provide one. If they do suggest them to add themselves here.
	
- The fork I want is listed here, but my platform is not available for download.
	- You will need to contact the fork asking if they are willing to build for your platform.
	
- The fork does not provide prebuilds (or any other issue where you are unable to retrive a server prebuild)
	- Your only choice is to compile the forks codebase yourself if available. Instructions can be found [here](../general-development/setup/server-hosting-tutorial.md#level-2-server-with-custom-code)

- I'm a server host and I want to add myself here.
	- You are free to make a PR yourself in the docs or ping @vasilisiscool (322708417540259841) in #hosting on discord with all the information needed.
