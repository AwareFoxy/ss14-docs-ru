# Captain
Amazing! You're the ship's captain, you have the final say on things (Unless there is a pesky inspector around..) and you might just be the most well-protected command member! As long as there are no [Powergamers](https://docs.goobstation.com/en/community/roleplay/jobs/bs.html) around..
# Superiors: Central Command
Better known as Admins!
# Access: All Access
Of course, this doesn't include syndicate and nuclear operative airlocks.
# Duties: Keep the station running, delegate your work to the other heads of staff, and exert your will!

# Overview
The captain's role on the station is to not run each department just because you have AA. Delegate your work to other heads of staff. Want a person demoted in cargo? Tell the QM to demote them for incompetency! If the QM refuses your order, then demote the QM!
## Security & You
Security is the most important department to have on your side, and to have fully staffed. Without security, it's like being alone in a cage full of tigers! Make sure to maintain relations with the crew & security and make sure the security department is competent. You don't want a tider uprising, do you? 
## Heads of Staff
You always want heads of staff on your side, if they start to talk behind your back, it looks bad for you and the entire station! Make sure your heads of staff are always in check and don't be hesitant to demote them if you think they're incompetent or unfit for duty.
## Tips for Captain
Remember you're not above [Space Law](https://docs.goobstation.com/en/community/roleplay/space-law.html), [server rules](https://docs.goobstation.com/en/community/roleplay/rules.html), and community expectations. Don't be a dickhead! 
Syndicates WILL kill you, whether it be for your gear, all access, or just for your fox, Renault! Always be on your toes. 
An absent captain is a bad captain, make sure to not leave the station unless you HAVE to, such as singulooses, teslaloose, and other events.
Your hard suit has less protection than your carapace, I don't suggest wearing it unless needed!
