## Overview
The Blueshield Officer's role on the station is to be a mentor to command members, such as teaching them the basics of how to lead the station sometimes! They are also there to protect command members, including those who are sent by Central Command such as Nanotrasen Representatives, Central Command Officials, and even interns!

You cannot become a captain of the station or any command member, bound by the rules. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5fe30e1d-0791-4ecf-83da-13c222254d85)
