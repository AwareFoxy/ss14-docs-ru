# Head Of Personnel 
You're the right-hand man of the Captain! You give people access that they usually might not have, you give the janitor RD's mantle without asking, and you care for your dog Ian! (or Lisa depending on the map!)
# Superiors; Captain, Central Command
# Access; Bridge, HOP, Medical, Chemistry, Science, Cargo, Salvage, Engineering, Atmospherics, Maints, Lawyer.
(Accesses may be wrong, correct me if needed!)
# Difficulty; Medium
Being the center of attention with your near All Access card and your dog being a Syndicate & Thief objective, it doesn't help that you're only handed a disabler! 
# Duties; Handle access reassignment fairly using your ID console, manage the service department, and keep Ian safe.

# Overview
The Head of Personnel's job is to sit at their desk and give people access, check in at the bar and kitchen, make sure the people you hire aren't actually syndicates and cry for help on the radio when your office is emagged and your dog gets dragged off into maints.
Other Heads of Staff may get mad at you for giving crew their mantle and uniforms, communication is KEY! Make sure to always ask the department head before giving someone a job in said department, such as asking on commmand or engineering comms if you can give engineering access to a security officer!
## Tips
Most of the times, your line will be empty, you'll be bored, and there will be nothing to do. Make sure to have a youtube tab open 24/7!

Don't powergame sec glasses! 

Most of the times admins won't get mad at you for bolting your office door on blue alert or higher.
