The Nanotrasen Representative's job is to make sure command is in order, correct and address any problems with them or their department, make sure the Blueshield Officer is in order, and fax CC regularly with the current station status. 

The Nanotrasen Representative, while higher than the Captain, does not control the station nor should be doing anything else apart from their main job. This also means taking up the Captain's role unless there are no other command members able to.
